Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship
Australian companies that provide work visas (and/or relocation) to their employees (mainly tech). The links below are for the career pages, not the main company website. Some companies listed below have mentioned visa sponsorship/relocation on StackOverflow jobs or communicated over email for certain tech roles and the "right" candidates.

The Australian Immigration Department needs to catch up with the UK Immigration Department. UK one has an official public list of thousands (last count ~30K) that can sponsor people. Tier 2 visa is the skilled job one.

Update Jan-2022, a long list of 70 pages PDF has been found on Right To know which lists 1000s of companies that have sponsored employees in temporary work visa. This can be a great list to do a reverse job search. Still, some companies might have stopped doing work visas in the past 2 years because of the pandemic.

If you work for a company in Australia that provides visa sponsorship to its employees, please add your employer as a PR. Here is an example PR.

A searchable sort-able and group-able version of the list of companies below is available on air table.

Scrolled this far, good!
If you have come this far you are looking for tech jobs in Australia. Lucky for you, check AU Tech Jobs for tech jobs in Australia from 85+ companies with a focus on work visa sponsorship.

If you are looking for tech jobs to relocate to other parts of the world (especially Europe), please visit Relocate.me. It is a great platform for people looking to relocate with jobs. The country guides in Relocate.me with relocation tips and expat stories are very useful.

Before applying for jobs
Before applying for (tech) jobs in Australia, please learn about the visa 482 and the conditions for lodging the visa. For example, 482 medium-term stream requires at least 2 years of relevant work experience.

Please have a look at the official list of skilled occupations to verify that your occupation is in that list. For example, digital marketing is not on that list. An easy way to find tech-related occupations is to search for "ACS" on that page because all tech occupations would be accessed by the Australian Computer Society (ACS).

PRs welcome
If you know of any company that provides work visa sponsorship for tech roles please open a PR to add it.

Starring the repo is highly recommended :) Thanks!

Disclaimer
Most companies in the above list have been pulled in from StackOverflow Jobs search with visa sponsor flag. We don't take any responsibility of these companies sponsoring employees or are still doing so.

Some companies only sponsor senior roles. Some of the companies have stated they can sponsor. So it will depend on how you would approach them, the role and your level of skills and experience. If you think any company above should be removed from the list please send a PR.
